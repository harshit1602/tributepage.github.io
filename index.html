    <u><h2>Insight into Dr Kalam's Life </h2></u>
    <p>
        <b>A</b>vul <b>P</b>akir <b>J</b>ainulabdeen <b>Abdul Kalam</b> or better known as APJ Abdul Kalam was born on 15th October, 1931, in Rameswaram, India.
        Dr Kalam was a leading scientist who played an important role in the development of <b>India’s Missile and Nuclear Weapons</b> programs.
        He served as the <b>11th President of India </b> for the tenure  2002-2007.<br>Widely referred to as the <b>"People's President".</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname <b>“Missile Man”</b>. Among those successes was <b>Agni</b>, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.
His pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's <b>Pokhran-II Nuclear tests</b> in 1998 , the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974 established Kalam as a <b>national hero</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam won the election and was sworn in as <b>India’s 11th president</b>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Kalam wrote several books, including an autobiography, <b><a href="https://ati.dae.gov.in/ati12052021_8.pdf" target="_blank">Wings of Fire (1999)</b></a>. Among his numerous awards were two of the country’s highest honours,the <b>The Padma Bhushan (1981)</b>, <b>The Padma Vibhushan (1990)</b> and <b>The Bharat Ratna (1997)</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed
On the morning of 29 July, Kalam's body, wrapped in the Indian flag, was taken to Palam Air Base and flown to Madurai
 After a brief ceremony, Kalam's body was flown by air force helicopter to the town of Mandapam, from where it was taken in an army truck to his hometown of Rameswaram. Upon arriving at Rameswaram, his body was displayed in an open area in front of the local bus station to allow the public to pay their final respects until 8 p.m. that evening.
<br>On 30 July 2015, the former president was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground with full state honours.
